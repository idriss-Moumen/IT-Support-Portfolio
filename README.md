# IT-Support-Portfolio
Hands-on IT Support portfolio (Help Desk, AD, hardware &amp; networking basics)
This repository contains hands-on IT support tasks and labs that I have completed while transitioning into an IT role.

The focus is on practical skills such as:
- Active Directory user management
- Hardware troubleshooting and replacement
- Data backup and recovery
- BitLocker troubleshooting
- Basic networking and device access

Each folder includes real-world scenarios with a short explanation of the issue, tools used, actions taken, and the result.
